Once upon a time, there lived three fishes in a pond. They were close friends and were living together for years, in the same pond.
One day, a fisherman passing through the way saw that the pond was filled with fishes.
He was surprised and delighted, and immediately informed his fellows about it. Together, they decided to come the next morning and catch those fishes.
One of the three fishes, who was also the wisest, heard the conversation between the fisherman and his fellows.
It immediately rushed to the other two and explained them the entire situation, and also suggested that they leave the pond immediately and move to another place.
The second fish agreed and decided to move out from the pond quickly.
The third fish, however, mocked at them. He felt that the pond was their home, and they must not leave their home.
Since the other two fishes were unable to convince the third fish, they left the pond and decided to let him follow his own course of action.
The next day, the fisherman and his fellows cast their nets and caught plenty of fishes. They also managed to catch the third fish, who had refused to leave the pond, while the other two fishes, who left earlier, were saved.
